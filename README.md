Deep Learning 1 course UvA

In this git repo all assignments are published of the Deep Learning 1 course of the UvA master Artificial Intelligence.
This repo is to help fellow students, however it is encouraged to only look at it for debugging purposses or implementation 
comparisons. Firstly implementing the assignments on your own give a major breakthough in your own understanding about the 
material, especially while it is easily plagiarized.
